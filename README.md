## Overview

Do you feel like it‚Äôs getting hotter day by day? You‚Äôre not imagining it. Global temperatures are rising at an alarming rate, leading to a host of devastating consequences, from reduced food supplies to severe flooding, health crises, and economic losses. The primary cause of this crisis is carbon emissions, which intensify the greenhouse effect and worsen global warming.

In addition to the climate crisis, traditional donation platforms face two critical challenges: lack of transparency in how funds are used and a lack of engaging experiences for contributors. Many platforms do not provide clear tracking, which discourages donations, while the absence of gamification and recognition makes contributions feel unengaging, failing to inspire repeat participation.

Sawatreekap aims to solve these problems by providing a blockchain-based platform for combating climate change through tree planting, ensuring transparency and enhancing user engagement through gamified experiences.

### Key Features
1. **Transparent Donations**: Every tree planted is recorded on the blockchain, allowing users to track their contributions and verify their impact.
2. **Gamified Experience**: Users earn unique NFTs representing each tree they plant, with metadata like planting date and location. Special achievements and leaderboards recognize contributions, making climate action engaging and rewarding.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Users receive real-time notifications and updates on their impact, keeping them engaged and informed.
